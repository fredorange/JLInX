                    Java PHA Sample for Indivo X 
                             JLInX


This is a sample project distributed within the JLInX library. 
It provides a Web application PHA and a Webless application that illustrates some 
library calls.

1) Update the file SampleConfig.java according to your Indivo configuration.

2) Create the sample application. Here is how it should like in indivo-data.xml:
  <user_app name='Testing App' email='jlinx-phaSample@apps.indivo.org'>
	<description>JLInX Sample PHA  @yourhost:port/jlinx-phaSample.</description>
	<consumer_key>jlinx-phaSample</consumer_key>
	<secret>secret</secret>
	<frameable>True</frameable>
	<has_ui>True</has_ui>
	<start_url_template>
	http://yourhost:port//jlinx-phaSample/start_auth?record_id={record_id}&#38;carenet_id={carenet_id}&#38;document_id={document_id}
	</start_url_template>
	<callback_url>
	http://yourhost:port//jlinx-phaSample/after_auth
	</callback_url>
  </user_app>

3) If needed, update the file AccessTokenDao.java. It is a simple token file store.

4) Build the project. A Maven POM file is provided, you may need to adapt it.

5) Deploy the generated 'pha sample' war artefact into your favorite target web
container. (Note that you should we've predefined in Indivo the web app, see 2).

6) You can now connect to Indivo GUI and add the Sample PHA to your record. You
should get a message confirmation that gives you the token information. The token
is stored according to the AccessTokenDao.java configuration. 

7) You can now build and run the WeblessPha.java application. It performs Indivo 
calls using the previously saved token.
